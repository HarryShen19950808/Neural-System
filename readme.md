# Neural Network
## Introduction
* The following is my course materials in Neural Network.
* `read_bin_file_test.py` is the traditional method of using sensor(such as velodyne lidar or ZED camera) to calculate distance.
* `depth_prediction_example.ipynb` is the pipeline of reconstruction the RGB image in `Monodepth2`.
